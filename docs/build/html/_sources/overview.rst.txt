Overview
========

FPGA_Arch_Exploration is used for explore the routing architecture for FPGAs.

In this project, the routing architecture is based on VIB architecture. To explore the magnificant design space for VIB architecture, Bayesian Optimization is used for efficient exploration. Bayesian Optimization is a probabilistic strategy for optimizing complex black-box functions across various parameters. At its core, BO constructs a surrogate model to approximate the objective function and utilizes an acquisition function to sample high-quality candidates, balancing exploration and exploitation.
